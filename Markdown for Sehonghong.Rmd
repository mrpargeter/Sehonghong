========================================================
ID - tools ID
Square: 2D at surface level that contains the data: Factors

Level - depths below surface: oldest to youngest: Factors
  - rfs: Oldest
  - mos: Second Oldest
  - bas: Third Oldest
  - rf: second youngest
  - barf: Youngest
*Data missing between rf and barf due to missing box

Unit - Features withing Level: Factors

Bag - arbitrary to know what actual bag the piece came from

Flake Portion: How much of the piece was examined
 - proximal: bottom part of the tool
 - proximal but nearly complete
 - medial: middle part of the tool
 - distal: end part
 - lateral: side part
 - core: lump of rock that tools come from; Not a tool - remove
 - complete
 - core on flake: can be included with complete and proximal for continuous variable analyses
 
L.max.: Maximum length
L.tech.: Technical length
W.mid.: Width at the middle of the tool
T.mid.: Thickness at the middle of the tool
T.bulb.: Thickness at the bulb
P.w.: Platform width - tools that are complete and proximal; not for medial, distal
P.t.:Platform thickness - tools that are complete and proximal; not for medial, distal
EPA: Exterior Platform Angle (used to calculate only) - tools that are complete and proximal; not for medial, distal
EPA Angle: Calculated angle  - tools that are complete and proximal; not for medial, distal
  - some proximal will be blank due to size issue; therefore this will have to be its own dataset
Length Profile: Curvature - measured by the height to the maximum curvature; for flakes only
  - 0 is flat; blank, NA could not be recorded or didn't make sense
Mass: Actual Mass; calculated in Step 1 for pieces that it was not measured

Overarching question: Currently, 
    RFS, MOS: Separate, transitional middle-stone-age --> later-stone-age layers; 
    BAS (24,000 - 18,000): Earliest part of roberg
    Missing Data: (14,900 - 14,150) *After 4000 year gap
    RF(14,500 - 13,700) & BARF: last part of roberg and separated from BAS by missing unit
    
    Omitting RF and BARF for now, are RFS/MOS significantly different from BAS

Phase 1: Mass calculations
Calculate the mass for flakes that are missing
Packages installed:
- data.table
-foreach

Steps:
 - Reads in the data - stored on hard -drive; ensure StringsAsFactors is False
 - Created ID column
 - Creates data frame of only complete and proximal flakes that are nearly complete 

Phase 2: For complete flakes, determine distribution of continuous data by Level
 - Once level is complete, examine by Unit by Level to determine if patterns exist
    - general statistics, 
    - Histograms or desity plots from ggplot
    - box plots
    - interlayer comparisons and significance tests
    - cluster analysis of correlation of lengths and widths - looking for 2:1 cluster
        - cluster by rock type as well
    
Phase 3: Platform analysis
For continuous platform data - Pw, Pt, EPA.angle
    - elongation ratio (Pw/Pt): cluster or other 
    
Phase 4: Categorical Data
